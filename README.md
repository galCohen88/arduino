# Arduino

###### **In the world of VMs and containers, there is something neat and beautiful in embedded code**

## Why I started this?

I heard about arduino few years ago in uni. The only thing I knew about it that it uses C as its programming language.
The starting motive was creating a servo opening my office door.

## Why not raspberry pi?
Raspberry Pi is great, but the idea of running code on another OS was not charming as running embedded code.
(and nothing against linux - I love it, I use it by daily basis). 

## Hardware
**Arduino board**

I'm using Arduino uno r3, why did i choose this one? because it was in stock in the shop, and recommended by the community.

**WIFI shield**

I'm using ESP8266 backed with SparkFun WiFi Shield
This shield enables the arduino operating as http server and client

**Servo motor**

I'm using HD-3001HB servo which is standard servo. In cases used with WIFI shield I added 4XAA batteries as external power source. 
In other cases - current from the arduino board will be enough.

## What is in the repo?
Neat and lean examples of usage for using the arduino board by itself, and examples using the WIFI shield with it.
